# ~~Drone Swarm Step 1: Acquire Assets~~

~~There are currently **33 members** in the Slack Group. You are able to get **2 drones per each Microsoft account**. If each person got two drones, we would have around **66 drones**. If each person created an additional alternate account, that would bring the number up to **132 drones**.~~

## ~~About the Drone~~
~~Microsoft is offering a promotion which rewards you with a free drone you try out their [Azure Cloud Computing Platform](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/). Microsoft's platform is really amazing, and this promotion gives you the opportunity to work with it first-hand.~~

~~The specific model of drone is the [Bitcraze Crazyflie 2.0](https://www.bitcraze.io/crazyflie-2/). If you do your research, you can normally buy this at **around $180 each, but we are able to get one for free** for trying out the Azure platform.~~

## ~~How to get it~~
~~[Microsoft gives you a bunch of 'labs' with directions to follow on this site.](https://tryazuremarketplace.com/) **Each lab takes around 1 hour to complete.** After following the directions from the lab, you take a few screenshots, upload them, and _badda bing badda boom_, you enter in your shipping address for a free drone.~~

### ~~What you Need~~

- ~~Free trial to Azure Platform, which requires:~~
  - ~~Phone number~~
