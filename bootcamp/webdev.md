So you want to learn web development? Here's the bare minimum courses we recommend you take. Feel free to take any other courses you see. Explore! This is only for those who need guidance and have absolutely no idea what they're doing.

| 1. [Learn HTML (3 hours)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html)<br>2. [Learn CSS (9 hours)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css)<br>3. [Introduction to JavaScript (*35 hours)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript)<br>4. [Make a Website (4 hours)](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website)<br> | 1. [Introduction to HTML and CSS (2 hours)](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/introduction-to-html-and-css)<br>2. [HTML Basics (3 hours)](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/html-basics-2)<br>3. [CSS Basics (8 hours)](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/css-basics)<br>4. [JavaScript Basics (6  hours)](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/javascript-basics) |

\*The complete Codecademy course on "Introduction to JavaScript" is not necessary. You can skip section 10 "Browser Compatibility and Transpilation" and section 11 "Modules." I'm pretty sure it won't take 35 hours.
