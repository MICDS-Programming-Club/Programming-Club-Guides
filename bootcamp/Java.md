### Looking Back
WOW! Are you still here, have you reconsidered your life choices at least once. If you answered yes to both these questions, you win. Go surf Reddit for a little while until you have a good idea for an app, or program, or web service. Then actually make that idea a reality. Have a service that utilizes an open API, use that to build something. While you're at it, look back on your hard work and learning.
