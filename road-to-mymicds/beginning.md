# New to Programming Altogether? Start Here!

Programming is the process of creating instructions for the computer to execute. For Frontend Web Development, those instructions are run in a browser (like Chrome or Firefox).

## First Course

We recommend you do the [Full Stack Javascript Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/full-stack-javascript) along with [Frontend Web Development Track](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development). This path would cover topics more in line with MyMICDS codebase. Full Stack Web Development refers to both Frontend and Backend Development. Frontend being what a website looks like and how it interacts with a user, and back end refers to the server code that handles Databases and Logins.
