# New to Programming Altogether? Start Here!

Programming is the process of creating instructions for the computer to execute. For Frontend Web Development, those instructions are run in a browser (like Chrome or Firefox).

## First Course

We Recommend Treehouse's [Full Stack Foundations](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/full-stack-foundations) course. Full Stack Web Development refers to both Frontend and Backend Development. Frontend being what a website looks like and how it interacts with a user, and back end refers to the server code that handles Databases and Logins.

Alternatively, you can do the [Full Stack Javascript](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/full-stack-javascript) along with [Frontend Web Development](https://teamtreehouse.com/tracks/front-end-web-development). This path would cover topics more in line with MyMICDS codebase.

## Just Developer Things

In addition to learning programming, learning the tools of the trade are equally important. Below are a couple of websites, pieces of software, and other things that a new developer should know about

1. **Git/Github**: Git is a version management system. While Github is an online storage platform for projects that use Git. Learn more about this [here](../introduction/github.md)
2. **Linter**: Being able to write code that other people can read easily is equally as important as being able to code in the first place. Linters ensure that the formatting of your code is consistent. For example, Linters ensure that you're using [tabs over spaces](../introduction/tabs_vs_spaces.md), or that you name your variables using the same pattern (`myVariable` vs `my_variable`).
3. **Google**: Google is your friend. It is okay to not understand something and to be lost at times. If you need an explanation of something, google can help. If you need help with a problem, google is your friend.
4. **Stackoverflow**: Stackoverflow is the biggest help forum for new programmers, many google searches about programming issues will come up with results from [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).
5. **IDE**: Integrated Development Environment, or a piece of software that you use to program offline. It's essentially a fancy text editor. A list of popular IDEs can be found [here](../introduction/set_up_ide.md).
