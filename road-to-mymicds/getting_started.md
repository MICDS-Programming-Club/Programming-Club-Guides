So, you've completed the intro courses to web develmoent and you're ready to start working on MyMICDS.net! Great job!

Here's what you need to do in order for you to start working on the website:

1. Install Git:<br>
  Git (as mentioned previously) is a tool that helps us collaborate on the website without writing over each other's changes. You'll need to install some way to interact with GitHub, which is where we have a repository for all of our code. If you are more advanced in the land of Git, download Git Bash. It's a command-prompt-based Git program. If you're not too experienced with Git, download GitHub Desktop. It has a GUI (<b>G</b>raphical <b>U</b>ser <b>I</b>nterface) to help you interact with our repository, but it's not as powerful as the command line. Once you start to feel comfortable with GitHub Desktop, it may be time to "graduate" to Bash. For a quick primer on how Git works, click <a href=''>here</a>. <!-- (TODO) -->
  
2. Install an IDE:<br>
  An IDE (<b>I</b>ntegrated <b>D</b>evelopment <b>E</b>nvironment) is software that makes it easier for you to edit the files that make up thw website. The default on Windows is Notepad, but this isn't very good for developers, as it isn't particularly friendly for large coding projects like this. There are plenty of different IDEs to choose from on the Internet, with their own unique pros and cons. Some suggestions:<br>
  <ul>
  <li>ATOM: A very minimalist IDE that can handle multiple languages, ATOM runs very quickly, but doens't have a lot of bells and whistles.</li>
  <li>Notepad++: Though lacking in terms of asthetics, Notepad++ is a powerful IDE that's easy to use for beginners, but has a lot of features for the more skilled. Overall a solid piece of software.</li>
  <li>Eclipse: Eclipse was made specifically for Java stuff and was then expanded to include other languages. I only put it here so no one would ask about it (just don't use it).</li>
  </ul>
  There are also IDEs that you can use directly in Git Bash if that's what you downloaded:
  <ul>
  <li>Vim: An incredibly powerful terminal-based text editor, Vim is one of the oldest IDEs out there. You'll have to navigate entirely by keyboard (because it was invented before the mouse), and many of the controls are very unfamiliar. It takes some mastery, but once you get used to it, there's no going back. Open it by going into Git Bash and typing <pre>$ vim [file]</pre></li>
  <li>Nano: Similar to Vim in most ways, but it looks a little nicer. Open it by going into Git Bash and typing <pre>$ nano [file]</pre></li>
  </ul>
  (The [file] is the path of the file you want to open. You don't literally type "[file]")
  
  Now that you have all the software from the internet installed, there's some messing around to do in the command prompt before you can get started. Have a look at that <a href=''>here</a>.
