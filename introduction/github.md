# How to Properly use Git/GitHub

## What is Git?
Git is what's called a **version control system**, which keeps track of changes you and other people make to a certain project. Version control systems are very helpful when working in projects, and allows for everyone to sync their code with multiple people on multiple devices.

Git consists of one main 'repository' or project, and other developers can sync the local repository on their machine with the main repository hosted on the web.
