# Resources to Learn
There are many resources available on the web to learn coding. Different formats work for different people, but here are a few websites you can visit to learn:

## General
These sites offer a variety of programming languages!

### [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)
Codecademy is a great plat to start. It offers a variety of courses based off of interactive coding challenges. This is a free resource!

### [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/home)
Treehouse is another great website. It offers a bigger selection than Codecademy, and goes a lot more in-depth in some topics. Courses are made up of a collection of short videos. Every few videos, you take a quiz or a coding challenge! **This is NOT a free resource, but you can contact Michael Gira to get the credentials to a paid group Treehouse account.**

### [Learn X in Y minutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/)
A great resource for people already experienced with programming to pick up another language. This site offers over 100 text-based tutorials that will teach you the basics and provide links to continue your learning!

## Angular 2
[Angular is a JavaScript library](https://angular.io/) used to build powerful single-page applications. It can also be used for other platforms, such as the [Ionic framework](http://ionicframework.com/) to build mobile apps!

### [Angular University](https://angular-university.io/)
The Angular University is a great resource for learning Angular 2. It has simple to-the-point videos that are only a few minutes long each.
