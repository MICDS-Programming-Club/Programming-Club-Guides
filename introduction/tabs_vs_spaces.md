# Tabs vs Spaces
When writing code, developers indent their code in a hierarchy to make it more readable. A holy war has been fought for centuries over the which character to use when indenting code: tabs or spaces? **A common misconception is that you should use spaces to indent. This is a false statement.** Here is a diagram below visually showing the differences between tabs and spaces.

Each dot represents a space, while each arrow represents a tab.

As you can see, **spaces are a waste of disk space** as it takes 2-4 space characters to indent, while it only takes 1 tab character to indent.

## An objective analysis on both sides of the debate
In order to remain unbiased on why **tabs are better than spaces in every single way for indentation**, we will objectively list all of the advantages and disadvantages for using each.

### Why should I use tabs?
- The tab character was specifically developed for indentation.
- You are able to configure how many characters a tab takes up, depending on your preference (typically 2 or 4 characters).
- All the cool kids are doing in.

### Why should I use spaces?

## **Please make sure you configure your IDE to use tabs and not spaces!**
Even though you are pressing the 'tab' key in order to indent your code, you might not necessarily be using tabs over spaces. Most IDE's allow you to insert x amount of spaces when you press the tab key. In order to make sure you are inserting a tab character instead of 2 or 4 spaces, look in the settings, config, or preferences of your favorite IDE.
