# I Have Absolutely No Idea What I'm Doing
New to programming? New to computers? What even is a computer? What even is life? This is the place to start.

# Step 1: Consult Resources
[Here is a list of learning resources that we recommend.](https://github.com/michaelgira23/Programming-Club-Guides/blob/master/introduction/learning_resources.md) Some of these resources require a paid account, which you can contact **Michael Gira via email (mgira@micds.org) or Slack** to obtain the group account credentials.

# Step 2: Which Languages should I learn?
In the programming club, we will probably be focusing on languages such as Python, and Web Development which means languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Depending on what you want to do in the programming club, it may require you learn a specific language.

## I want to create a website
In order to make a website on your own, you **must** learn the front-end languages HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Back-end languages are optional, and are required if you want to do more than simply serve a static site. You need to know a back-end language if you want a login system or want to work with databases.

### Front-End Languages
The front-end of a website is the interface of the website that you actually see.

#### HTML and CSS
HTML is the backbone structure of the webpage, while CSS is what makes a website look pretty.

#### JavaScript
JavaScript makes a webpage interactive. You can create animations and do lots of other things!

### Back-End Languages
There are many back-end languages out there, but you only need to know one to build a website. Each language has their own advantages and disadvantages.

#### node.js
Node.js is actually JavaScript, but running on the back-end. If you know JavaScript, you already know the syntax of node.js. You just need to learn a few extra stuff to make node.js interact with things. You can learn node.js by taking the following courses:
1. [Node.js Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/nodejs-basics)
2. [Build a Simple Dynamic Site with Node.js](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-simple-dynamic-site-with-nodejs)
3. [npm Basics](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/npm-basics)
4. [Build a REST API With Express](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-rest-api-with-express)

#### PHP
PHP is a bit older language. It has its quirks, but it's still decent for making a website. There are both courses on Codecademy and Treehouse, so you can take whatever you prefer.

2. [Build a Basic PHP Website](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-basic-php-website)

#### Ruby / Ruby on Rails
Ruby is a general programming language. The 'Ruby on Rails' framework allows for you to run a webserver using the Ruby language.

#### Python / Django
Python is another general programming language. The Django framework allows for you to run a webserver using Python. You can take the following Treehouse courses:
